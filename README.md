## The Data
All data are from the [Subadult Virtual Anthropology Database](https://zenodo.org/communities/svad/records?q=&l=list&p=1&s=10&sort=newest). Specifically, this project uses portions of the data from the [United States](https://zenodo.org/records/5193208), [South Africa](https://zenodo.org/records/3950301), and [Colombia](https://zenodo.org/records/7668554). Note, Figure 1 does utilize data from the Harpenden Growth dataset (Tanner 1981; Johnson 2024).

## The Files
All code to recreate the results, figures, and tables can be found in the `code` folder. For ease, each individual part of the analysis is encapuslated in a single .R file. 

1. [model_fit.R](https://github.com/ChristopherAWolfe/Wolfe_MonotonicGrowth_AJBA/blob/main/code/model_fit.R) imports all SVAD data and fits the requisite growth models.
2. [Figure1.R](https://github.com/ChristopherAWolfe/Wolfe_MonotonicGrowth_AJBA/blob/main/code/Figure1.R) recreates Figure 1. Note, the Harpenden dataset is required for full reproducibility.
3. [Figure2.R](https://github.com/ChristopherAWolfe/Wolfe_MonotonicGrowth_AJBA/blob/main/code/Figure2.R) recreates Figure 2.
4. [Figure3.R](https://github.com/ChristopherAWolfe/Wolfe_MonotonicGrowth_AJBA/blob/main/code/Figure3.R) recreates Figure 3.
5. [Figure4.R](https://github.com/ChristopherAWolfe/Wolfe_MonotonicGrowth_AJBA/blob/main/code/Figure4.R) recreates Figure 4.
6. [Figure5.R](https://github.com/ChristopherAWolfe/Wolfe_MonotonicGrowth_AJBA/blob/main/code/Figure5.R) recreates Figure 5.
7. [Figure6.R](https://github.com/ChristopherAWolfe/Wolfe_MonotonicGrowth_AJBA/blob/main/code/Figure6.R) recreates Figure 6. Note, the [errors_in_variables_growth.stan] model is required for this step.
8. [tables.R](https://github.com/ChristopherAWolfe/Wolfe_MonotonicGrowth_AJBA/blob/main/code/tables.R) recreates Tables 2-5 from the text.

Note, the [Supporting Information](https://github.com/ChristopherAWolfe/Wolfe_MonotonicGrowth_AJBA/blob/main/SI_Submission1.pdf) file is also included for full model transparency and description.
